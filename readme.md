#Github Actions Deploy CLI
Use this to trigger deployments with github actions.
Replace your old, sad and clumsy CD tooling with the most basic command
line client known to man.

##Usage
`go run main.go deploy --repo=<repo>
--ref=<commit ref> --environment=<deployment env>
--user-id=<repo owner>
--token="<personal access token>"`
